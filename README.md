# BearWorld
Repo for a prototype of a new game called Bear World
Requires Xbox controller, though support for mouse exists, but support for switching between the two does not exist as part of the game and must be done through Unity editor
This game is still undergoing a lot of work, when I'm not working, I try to spend time improving the targeting. 
Please let me know if you have any ideas about ways to write 3rd person targeting code similar to Dark Souls, where you can switch the targets easily using controller joysticks.

Usage:
No builds, but:
Click play on the editor to see what the current testing version looks like - simple sandbox environment to select enemies and test basic scripts for gameplay
